![Era Code Banner](https://github.com/ThomasClaiborne/EraCode/blob/main/Images/PlayerPistolImage.png)

## üìù Overview
Era Code is a top-down defense shooter where players defend against waves of diverse robot enemies in intense fixed-position combat. Players have access to various weapon categories including SMGs, ARs, pistols, rocket launchers, and LMGs, each with unique characteristics and behaviors.

## üéÆ Key Features

### Weapon System
- **Modular Weapon Framework**: Highly configurable weapon properties including damage, fire rate, and magazine capacity
- **Special Slot System**: First slot reserved for infinite-ammo pistols as reliable fallback options
- **Visual Feedback**: Distinct bullet tracers for different weapon types providing visual combat cues
- **Dynamic Weapon Shop**: Allows purchasing, upgrading, and managing your arsenal

### Economy & Progression
- **Synthium Currency**: Resource earned through combat used to purchase upgrades and ammunition
- **Persistent Inventory**: Save/load system tracking unlocked weapons, loadouts, and currency

### Enemy AI
- **Wave Spawning System**: Configurable spawn intervals and waypoints for varied enemy encounters
- **Intelligent Positioning**: Advanced attack point system with front/back row positions to prevent enemy clustering
- **Diverse Enemy Types**: Multiple enemy behaviors featuring different attack patterns and projectile types

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The game is built with a component-based architecture focusing on:
- **Data-Driven Design**: Weapon properties and wave configurations stored in ScriptableObjects
- **System Decoupling**: Clean separation between weapon, economy, and enemy AI systems
- **Optimized Spawning**: Streamlined spawn interval configuration for improved performance

### Code Highlights
- Optimized waypoint-based enemy pathing system
- Queue-based position management for enemy distribution
- Persistent save/load system for game progression
- Highly extensible weapon configuration framework

## üéØ Development Scope
Era Code was developed as a solo project during the Devtober game jam over a 4-week period. The project demonstrates proficiency in:
- C# programming in Unity
- Gameplay systems design and implementation
- Enemy AI behavior programming
- Performance optimization techniques
